# Datasets used in the paper "A new deep learning calibration method enhances genome-based prediction of continuous crop traits"

In this repository you can find the four datasets used in this paper in two formats, CSV and RData.

# Data description

## 1.Maize

Dataset 1. Maize grain yield prediction. As previously reported by [Montesinos-Lopez et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.116.032359) this dataset consists of a sample of 309 maize lines evaluated for three traits: anthesis-silking interval, plant height, and grain yield (GY). Each trait was evaluated in three optimal environments (denoted Env1, Env2 and Env3).

## 2.Groundnut

Dataset 2. Groundnut seed yield per plant (SYPP) prediction. The phenotypic dataset [Pandey et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03658-1) contains information on the phenotypic performance for various traits in 4 environments. It contains 318 lines in 4 environments denotes as Environment1, (ENV1): Aliyarnagar_Rainy 2015; Environment2 (ENV2):Jalgoan_Rainy 2015; Environment3 (ENV3):ICRISAT_Rainy 2015; Environment4 (ENV4):ICRISAT Post-Rainy 2015. The dataset is balanced, giving a total of 1272 assessments with each line included once in each environment.

## 3.Chickpea

Dataset 3. Chickpea biomass prediction. The phenotypic dataset reported by [Roorkiwal et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-30027-2) contains information for 315 lines evaluated in 6 environments (denoted as 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7) for biomass. The dataset is balanced with all lines assessed in all environments, giving a complete observation dataset for 1,890 lines.

## 4.EYT

Spring wheat data was available from the Global Wheat Program (GWP) at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center ([CIMMYT](https://data.cimmyt.org/dataverse/cimmytdatadvn)) from elite yield trials (EYT) evaluated in four selection environments (denoted Bed5IR, EHT, Flat5IR, FlatDrip). The dataset included the performance data from the 2016-2017 cycle from a total of 980 lines assessed in the four environments, giving 3920 observations.
